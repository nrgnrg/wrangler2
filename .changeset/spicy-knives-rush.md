"wrangler": patch
---

Adds a `--plugin` option to `wrangler pages functions build` which compiles a Pages Plugin. More information about these WIP plugins can be found here: https://github.com/gregbrimble/pages-plugins. This wrangler build is required for both the development of, and inclusion of, plugins.
